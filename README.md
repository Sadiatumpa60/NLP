# Text Analysis from Natural Language Processing using different Machine Learning Models


## What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural language processing is a massive field of study and actively used practice which aims to make sense of language using statistics and computers. Some interesting NLP areas  are: topic identification, chatbots, text classification, translation, sentiment analysis.

## About the project:
In this project we are doing text analysis from different language. And then we have applied Machine learning models on two different Cross Validation Tecniques.They are Hold Out Validation and Monte Carlo Validation.
